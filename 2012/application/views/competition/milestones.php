<h3>Milestone 1 - Database</h3>
<p>For this, you will need to have your full database schema designed, a working
	database setup (which can certainly change over the course of the competition), and a substantial
	amount of data already in the database (at least 1000 rows over all the tables).
</p>

<h3>Milestone 2 - Dynamic Data</h3>
<p>
	For this, you will need to have a page on your site with dynamic data.
	This doesn't have to be fancy. A simple search box that shows different data depending on what 
	search term you use would be sufficient.
</p>

<h3>Milestone 3 - Third Party Integration OR Data Visualization</h3>
<p>
	For this, you will need to integrate with a 3rd party (e.g. Facebook, Google Maps, etc). You also 
	have the choice of a data visualization. Using graphs and charts is one simple example. We encourage
	you to creatively mix and match common ideas or create something new entirely.
