<h1 class="headline center"><strong>Rookie Division</strong></h1>

<div class="hr"></div>

<p>This year, 6.470 will feature a rookie division in addition to the main competition. The rookie division will have separate rankings and prizes.</p>

<p>The purpose of the rookie division is to allow new web programmers a chance to compete in a less intense environment. <b>Only teams with little to no web programming experience should join the rookie division.</b> We reserve the right to move teams from the rookie division to the main competition or even disqualify teams from 6.470 altogether if we believe they intentionally attempted to violate the spirit of the rookie division.</p>

<p>Teams with a majority (more than 50%) of Course 6 juniors, seniors, and grad students are prohibited from the rookie division unless you receive permission from the 6.470 staff. We believe that most of these students have sufficient general programming experience that they should not be considered rookies in a programming competition. Please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:6.470-staff@mit.edu">6.470-staff@mit.edu</a> before Milestone 1 (1/13/13) if your team would like permission.</p>

Teams will specify whether they'd like to participate in the rookie division in <?php echo HTML::anchor('competition/milestones#milestone1', 'Milestone 1'); ?>.(Additional Question 2) Teams will be allowed to switch from the rookie division to the main competition until <?php echo HTML::anchor('competition/milestones#milestone2', 'Milestone 2'); ?>. (Optional Question 1) Teams cannot switch from the main competition into the rookie division after Milestone 1.
