<p>6.470 is a popular, fast-growing annual month-long competition hosted by MIT students that attracts talented MIT hackers interested in web programming. Last year, we had over 180 students enrolled. Teams of 1-3 students compete to build the best dynamic, database-backed website based on common themes set by the annual 6.470 Challenge. Sponsors will receive various benefits including 
</p>
<ul>
<li>logos on the 6.470 website, T-shirts and other material</li>
<li>the contacts and resumes of registered students</li>
<li>networking opportunities with top performers</li>
<li>an opportunity to give guest lectures to promote web-related technologies or APIs</li>
<li>the opportunity to provide a competition judge.</li>
</ul>
