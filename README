= MIT 6.470 Web Site

This is the source code for the MIT 6.470 IAP Web Programming Competition. It is
open-sourced because any motivated person can use a spider to get all the pages
anyway.


== Layout

Each year has its own distinct directory. This has the downside of duplicated 
files, but it makes things easier to manage. Besides, git is good at detecting
exact duplicates, and only stores them once.

Each year's directory is organized as follows:
    * the root has HTML files
    * /images - PNG, JPEG, GIF images
    * /javascripts - JS files
    * /stylesheets - CSS files


== Deployment

The root of this repository is deployed in AFS at
    /afs/athena.mit.edu/course/6/6.470/web_scripts

The www directory contains an index.html which redirects to the site's root. It
is deployed in AFS at
    /afs/athena.mit.edu/course/6/6.470/index.html
    /afs/athena.mit.edu/course/6/6.470/www/index.html
