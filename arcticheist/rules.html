	<h2>Official Rules</h2>
	<hr />
	<p><b> Note: The rules are subject to minor changes. We will go over the rules including any changes at the start of the competition. </b></p>


	<p>Teams of 1-3 current MIT students will be eligible to compete for top prizes. A Casual Division exists for MIT alum or students from other schools if they wish to participate.</p>
<p>Each team is permitted one laptop to share between the three team members. Teams must be on-site in order to compete. Teams may not use other electronic devices to aid them during the competition.</p>

<p>During the competition, teams may access any website for reference purposes only. They may use Google as long as they are signed out.
Teams may not access websites that require them to log in or websites that allow them to communicate with anyone outside their team (including but not limited to e-mail, Facebook, Twitter). 
If a team is seen accessing any such website (even if their intent was not to cheat) or using another electronic device for reference or communication, they will immediately be disqualified.</p>

<p>Each round will be 45 minutes in length and will consist of anywhere from 6 - 10 problems.
The problems in a round are weighted and harder questions will be worth more points. There will be no partial credit on problems. 
For each problem, a team will either receive full credit for completing the problem or no credit otherwise. The maximum score for each round is 1000 points.</p>

<p>The rankings for each round will be determined by high score, with ties broken by first team to reach their final round score. </p>

<p>The winner of the overall competition will be determined by adding up the rankings for all three rounds. For example, a team that gets 3rd, 2nd, and 4th in the three rounds will  have a ranking sum of 3 + 2 + 4 = 9. The team with the lowest ranking sum will be the winner. Ties will be broken by total number of points earned in the 3 rounds.</p>

<p>Prizes will be awarded for the top 3 overall teams, as well as for the top team in each round that is not in the top 3 overall. A team cannot receive the top prize in more than one round. Ties will be broken by first team to reach their final point value for the round.</p>

<p>Note: Our competition website is standardized on Chrome, so we encourage you to use Chrome during the competition for best results.</p>

<pre>The testing framework does not include any JS library by default. 
However, most contestants will probably want to use jQuery, prototype, etc.

To use a library, include the following magic comment in your JavaScript:

// js_library: jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js

You have to use the "js_library:" magic keyword, followed by a path to a library on cdnjs.com. 
Go to cdnjs.com, find your library on the list, 
and remove the "//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/" prefix from the path on the list.

We currently only allow the use of JS libraries hosted on cdnjs.com.

----

The testing framework can compile LESS, SCSS, SASS, and CoffeeScript for you.
 Make the first line of your code one of the following magic comments.

# compiler: coffee
// compiler: less
// compiler: sass
// compiler: scss</pre>
